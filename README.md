# Algorithm Visualizer

**Algorithm Visualizer** is a web-based application designed to help users understand and learn algorithms through interactive visualizations. The project currently supports visualizing Binary Search and Sorting algorithms with customizable settings.

## Features

### ðŸ“Œ Binary Search Visualizer
- Step-by-step demonstration of the **Binary Search** algorithm.
- Visual representation of the search space being halved iteratively or recursively.
- User-friendly interface to input a sorted list and target value.

### ðŸ“Œ Sorting Algorithm Visualizer
- Visualizations for popular sorting algorithms, such as:
  - **Bubble Sort**
  - **Selection Sort**
  - **Insertion Sort**
  - **Merge Sort**
  - **Quick Sort**
- Adjustable speed for animations, allowing users to control the pace of the visualization.
- Adjustable size for the list's size, allowing users to control the size of the list.
- Highlights comparisons, swaps, and sorted sections for better understanding.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML, CSS, JavaScript**: The core technologies used to build the app's user interface and logic.
